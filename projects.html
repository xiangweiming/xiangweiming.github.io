<h2>Analysis and Control of Hybrid Dynamical Systems</h2>
<p>
A hybrid system is a dynamical system that exhibits both continuous and discrete dynamic behavior, a system that can both flow (described by a differential equation) and jump (described by a state machine or automaton). The hybrid system framework offers an elegant way to model complex many technological systems, in which logic decision making and embedded control actions are combined with continuous physical processes such as a  variety of  Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), e.g., collision avoidance protocols in air traffic control,  obstacle avoidance algorithms,  software-controlled medical devices, etc.

I am personally interested in the development of new theoretical results for the analysis and control of hybrid systems. My recent work proposed novel stability criteria for hybrid systems with time-dependent switching in the framework of multiple Lyapunov functions, including non-conservative stability criteria, formulated in terms of LP, SDP, and SOS conditions.
The results are further developed to a variety of hybrid systems such as stochastic switching systems, positive hybrid systems, uncertain hybrid systems, etc, as well as control synthesis of hybrid systems, e.g., event-triggered control.

<h2>Verification of Neural Network Systems</h2>
<p>
Artificial neural networks are used in systems that introduce machine learning components to resolve complex of neural networks problems. This can be attributed to the impressive ability to approximate complex functions as shown by the Universal Approximation Theorem. However, the data-driven nature and lack of efficient methods for analysis of neural networks leads to, in most cases, the treatment of neural networks as black boxes with no assurance in safety. Verifying neural networks is a difficult problem, and it has been demonstrated that validating even simple properties about their behavior is NP-complete. I am personally interested in develop verification algorithms in the framework of reachability of neural networks. The developed set-valued reachability framework aims to compute output set of a neural network, then system properties such as safety property can be verified by checking therelationship, e.g., intersection, between output set and specification set.

I am developing efficient and scalable reachability-based verification frameworks of nerual networks. Simulation-guided methods incorperated with interval arithmetic are proposed for neural networks with general activation functions. Polyhedra computation framework is developed for neural networks with ReLU activation function.

<h2>Trustworthy Data-Driven Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems</h2>
<p>
Modern control systems, e.g., medical robotic systems, autonomous vehicles and a variety of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), have been increasingly benefiting from the recent rapid development of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. In the foreseeable future, there will be intensive interactions between ML and dynamical control system domains in various stages of modeling, sensing, and control.Overthe next decade, the biggest generator of data is expected to be devices which sense and control the physical world. Effective and trustworthy data-driven methods are required to meet and handle the explosion of data emerging from the physical world. Moreover, with the progress of adversarial machine learning, traditional methods dealing with uncertainties and disturbances such as robust control methods are no longer valid as long as the perturbations and attacks might be purposefully crafted by adversarial opponents rather than random noise. Thus, new assured ML methods and processes are required for the data-driven modeling and control processes of CPS to assure formal guarantees of desired properties.
<br />
<br />

I am personally interested in developing post-modeling and design verification methods as well as correct-by-design methods to acheive trustworthness of data-driven modeling and control of CPS.
