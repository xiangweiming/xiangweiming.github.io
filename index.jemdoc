*Brief Bio:* I am going to join the [https://augusta.edu/ccs/ School of Computer and Cyber Sciences] at [https://augusta.edu Augusta University] this summer as an Assistant Professor. Before joining [https://augusta.edu Augusta University], I am now working as a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the [https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/ Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science] at [https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ Vanderbilt University] (Sep 2016 -- Jul 2019), and worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [https://cse.uta.edu/ Department of Computer Science and Engineering] at the [https://www.uta.edu/ University of Texas at Arlington] (Nov 2015 -- Aug 2016), a Research Associate in the [http://me.hku.hk/ Department of Mechanical Engineering] at the [https://www.hku.hk/ University of Hong Kong] (May 2015 -- Oct 2015), and briefly in the [https://ctt.swjtu.edu.cn/ School of Transportation and Logistics] at [https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/ Southwest Jiaotong University] as an Associate Professor (Jun 2014 -- May 2015). I completed my Ph.D. at [https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/ Southwest Jiaotong University] in 2014 with a Ph.D. thesis on formal methods for hybrid traffic systems awarded the Outstanding Ph.D. Dissertation of Southwest Jiaotong University 2014.

*Research:* My research interest is developing formal synthesis and verification techniques and software tools for cyber-physical systems (CPS). My current research centers on /*formal methods on safety, security and reliablity of learning-enabled CPS*/. 
I am also broadly interested in methods and applications across CPS domains, such as control synthesis, stability analysis, reachable set computation, hybrid systems,  power and energy, transportation, fuzzy logic, and neural networks.
